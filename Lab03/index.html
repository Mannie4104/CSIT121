                <p>Designing my first webpage was pretty simple and fun, I'll admit. I expected it to be more difficult, but it wasnâ€™t. Creating an HTML webpage simply comes down to properly structuring your page and understanding the required tags. I look forward to learning how to style my page more in the future.</p>
                <h3>What I learned</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Most HTML elements are coded as a pair of tags: an opening and closing tag. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets.</li>
                    <li>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.</li>
                    <li>An internal hyperlink links to another page or a section within the same website.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>I'm most excited about learning how to build a website and developing the skills needed to make it both colorful and creative.</p>

                    <li><a href="https://Mannie4104.github.io/CSIT121/Lab/aboutme.html">Lab 01: Web Publishing</a></li>
                    <li>External links point to a different website or domain, not within the current site.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Styling my first webpage was an exciting experience. I was thrilled to have the opportunity to bring my ideas to life and make the design visually appealing. With the help of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), I was able to customize the background color and font size. It felt nice to see my webpage transform from a simple structure into something a little more engaging.</p>
                <h3>What I learned</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
                    <li id="alert">The three main parts of a CSS rule are HTML selectors, ID selectors, and class selectors.</li>
                    <li>An ID selector should be used when you want to apply a style to just one specific element.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>I enjoyed learning how to style a website and somewhat bring it to life. I hope to learn more ways to customize a website.</p>
