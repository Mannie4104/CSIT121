            <P>Designing my first webpage was pretty simple and fun, I'll admit. I expected it to be more difficult, but it wasnâ€™t. Creating an HTML webpage simply comes down to properly structuring your page and understanding the required tags. I look forward to learning how to style my page more in the future</P>
    <h3>What i learned</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Most HTML elements are codes as a pair of tags, an opening and closing tags. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets,</li>
        <li>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language it is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. ,</li>
        <li>An internal hyperlink links to another page or a section within the same website,.</li>
    </ol>
    <P>I'm most excited about is learning how to build a website and developing the skills needed to make it both colorful and creative.</P>
