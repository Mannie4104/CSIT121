            <P>Designing my first webpage was pretty simple and fun, I'll admit. I expected it to be more difficult, but it wasnâ€™t. Creating an HTML webpage simply comes down to properly structuring your page and understanding the required tags. I look forward to learning how to style my page more in the future</P>
    <h3>What i learned</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Most HTML elements are codes as a pair of tags, an opening and closing tags. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets,</li>
        <li>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language it is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. ,</li>
        <li>An internal hyperlink links to another page or a section within the same website,.</li>
    </ol>
    <P>I'm most excited about is learning how to build a website and developing the skills needed to make it both colorful and creative.</P>

            <P>Styling my first webpage was an exciting experience. I was thrilled to have the opportunity to bring my ideas to life and make the design visually appealing. With the help of CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) I was able to customize the background color, front size. It felt nice to see my webpage transform from a simple structure into something a little more engaging</h3>
    <ol>
     <h3> What I learned</h3>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
        <li id="alert">Three main parts of a CSS rule is HTML selectors, ID Selectors, Class Selectors</li>
        <li>An ID Selectors should be used when you want to apply a style to just one specific element.</li>
    </ol>
    <P>I enjoyed learning how to style a website and some what bring it to life, i hope to learn more ways to custimized a webseite.</P>
